## Introduction

The Artisanal Coffee Roastery Management System is a PL/SQL-based database solution designed to streamline operations for specialty coffee producers. Inefficient manual processesâ€”such as order tracking, inventory management, and quality controlâ€”often lead to stock discrepancies, delayed shipments, and inconsistent roast profiles. This system leverages PL/SQLâ€™s automation, transactional integrity, and real-time analytics to eliminate these challenges. Stored procedures automate order fulfillment, triggers synchronize inventory updates, and constraints enforce quality standards in roasting logs. By centralizing data in a relational model, the system ensures accurate supplier tracking, prevents stockouts, and maintains batch consistencyâ€”key requirements for a competitive coffee business.

PL/SQL is ideal for this project due to its seamless integration with Oracle databases, procedural logic for complex workflows, and robust error handling. The system transforms raw data into actionable insights through analytical functions for sales reports and materialized views for performance optimization. Beyond operational efficiency, it enhances decision-making by providing managers with real-time visibility into inventory, supplier performance, and customer trends. This project demonstrates how database management principles, applied through PL/SQL, can solve real-world supply chain challenges while maintaining the artisanal quality that defines specialty coffee.
